# Development docs

This documentation is technical in nature. The documentation is divided into english and spanish documentation for accesibility reasons. Documentation will be labeled with the standard [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) language code. For example, spanish docs will be labeled "es_foo.md", if in the future you add your own documentation in your native language, please stick to this convention.
